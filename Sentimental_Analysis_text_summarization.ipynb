Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people.

Snape's lips curled into a sneer. \"Let's try again. \"What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?\" Why aren't you all copying that down?\" There was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose. \"Take him up to the hospital wing,\" Snape spat at Seamus. \"Doi* push it,\" he muttered, \"I've heard Snape can turn very nasty.\" \"Hang on,\" he said. \" He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound. said Hagrid, glancing at Ron's freckles. Can't get rid of her -- Fitch puts her up to it.\" Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day. And did Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn't want to tell Harry? Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his grandmother had never let him near one. Gran knows I forget things -- this tells you if there's something you've forgotten to do.

She had short, gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk. \"UPF everyone shouted. Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he'd been doing it wrong for years. Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his. \" Did you see his face, the great lump?\" The other Slytherins joined in. said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the grass. \" It's that stupid thing Longbottom's gran sent him.\" \"I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find -- how about -- up a tree?\" \"Give it here!\" He hadn't been lying, he could fly well. Hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called, \"Come and get it, Potter!\" \"Catch it if you can, then!\" he shouted, and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground. \"HARRY POTTER!\" His heart sank faster than he'd just dived. Now he'd done it. He hadn't even lasted two weeks. Professor McGonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys.

When are you getting the train back to the Muggles?\" Tonight, if you want. Wands only -- no contact. Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage. Excuse me.\" It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown. said Ron furiously. \" \"I almost told your brother,\" Hermione snapped, \"Percy -- he's a prefect, he'd put a stop to this.\" Hermione wasn't going to give up that easily. \"Go away.\" \" Hermione had turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting. If he finds all three of us I'll tell him the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you can back me up.\" \"Keep your voice down, Neville. \"Fine,\" said Neville, showing them. \" Malfoy and Crabbe weren't there yet. They edged along the walls, keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room. It was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris. Horror-struck, Harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they scurried silently toward the door, away from Filch's voice. They could hear Filch getting nearer. Shut up, Peeves -- please -- you'll get us thrown out.\" Peeves cackled. \"Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? \"Oh, move over,\" Hermione snarled. \"He thinks this door is locked,\" Harry whispered. \" The forbidden corridor on the third floor.

As seven o'clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field. \"Hey, Potter, come down!' \"Very nice,\" said Wood, his eyes glinting. \" \"Three Chasers, one Keeper,\" said Harry, who was determined to remember it all. \" These two are the Bludgers.\" He bent down and freed one of the Bludgers.

Harry left, before Snape could take any more points from Gryffindor. What's the matter?\" In a low whisper, Harry told them what he'd seen. That's where he was going when we saw him -- he's after whatever it's guarding!

It was enough. \"He didn't catch it, he nearly swallowed it,\" Flint was still howling twenty minutes later, but it made no difference -- Harry hadn't broken any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results -- Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty. Harry heard none of this, though. He was cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn't take his eyes off you.\" Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell him. He tried to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. Hagrid dropped the teapot. \"How do you know about Fluffy?\" That's top secret, that is.\" said Harry, \"so there's someone called Nicolas Flamel involved, is there?\" Hagrid looked furious with himself. The few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before they could fly off again. No one could wait for the holidays to start. Then he'd realized that nobody found this funny, because they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick.

He had to start somewhere. \"You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was wandering around at night, and somebody's been in the library Restricted Section.\" Harry felt the blood drain out of his face. A door stood ajar to his left. He stepped in front of it. There he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others. A woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving. Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection. \"You can come tonight, I'm going back, I want to show you the mirror. \" Anyway, maybe it only shows dead people. Shame about not finding Flamel, though. What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again. \"I'm freezing,\" said Ron. \" I know it's here somewhere.\" It's here -- just here -- yes!\" They pushed the door open. Harry whispered. \"I can't see anything.\" \"Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am.\" Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he couldn't see his family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas.

After what seemed an age, she turned and left. \"This isn't safe -- she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us. The snow still hadn't melted the next morning. \" What if they walk into you? But Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get back in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn't going to stop him. Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror.

UP another staircase, then another -- even one of Harry's shortcuts didn't make the work much easier. \"Detention!\" And twenty points from Slytherin! Harry Potter's coming -- he's got a dragon!\" \"Malfoy's got detention! Chuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing about in his crate. At last, Norbert was going... going... gone.
